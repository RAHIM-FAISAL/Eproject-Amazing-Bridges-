                    was built sometime around 1300 – 1190 BCE and was part of a larger highway in the area. There are
                    three other corbel arch bridges near Arkadiko, all similar in design and age.</p>

                <p>The Tarr Steps are an ancient clapper bridge (bridge form mostly found in the moors of Devon,
                    England) located across the River Barle in Exmoor National Park in Somerset, England. No one knows
                    for sure how old the bride is but the Tarr Steps could date back to at least 1000 BCE.

                    The Tarr Steps consist of 17 giant slabs (total of 180 feet long) and are considered the best
                    example of a clapper bridge. According to local legend, the Tarr Steps were built by the Devil so he
                    could sunbathe on the stones. The bridge has been damaged in recent years by flood waters but has
                    been rebuilt.

                    went up in 62 BCE and has remained in continuous use.</p>

                    Alcántara Bridge began in 104 CE and ended two years later.Although the bridge is currently in good
                    condition, it has had to be repaired several times throughout its history. Most of the bridge’s
                    damage was due to wars rather than the elements. Various parts of Alcántara Bridge were destroyed at
                    different time periods until the main pillars were completely repaired in 1969.</p>

                    constructed mausoleum, which is now known as the Castel Sant’Angelo. In the past, the bridge was
                    called Pons Aelius, meaning the Bridge of Hadrian.

                    Pons Sant’Angelo was designed by the famous Italian sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini and
                    it was completed in 134 CE. The bridge’s most distinctive feature are the numerous angel statues
                    standing on the bridge’s pillars. Today, the bridge is solely used by pedestrians and provides a
                    scenic view of the Tiber River and the Castel Sant’Angelo.

                    The Cendere Bridge (also known as Severan Bride or Septimius Severus Bridge) is a Roman bridge
                    dating from the late Imperial Roman period. It is located near the ancient city of Arsameia in
                    southeastern Turkey. While an older bridge may have existed in the same spot, the current Cendere
                    Bridge is dated to around 200 BCE.

                    A legion of the Imperial Roman army, Legio XVI Gallica, is credited with building the bride so they
                    could begin a war with Parthia. Four Corinthian-style columns were added to bridge n honor of the
                    Roman Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus (193–211), his second wife Julia Domna, and their sons
                    Caracalla and Publius Septimius Geta.

                    The Cendere Bridge is now apart of one of the most important national parks in Turkey, which is a
                    UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

                <p>The Band-e Kaisar of Bridge of Valerian was a Roman stone arch bridge built in what is now Shushtar,
                    Iran. At the time it was built, around 260 – 270 CE, the bridge was combined with a dam — making
                    Band-e Kaisar the first of its kind in the country. The bridge/dam was the most eastern Roman
                    bridge/dam, lying deep in Persian territory.

                    According to Persian history, Band-e Kaisar was named after the Roman Emperor Valerian, who was
                    captured with his entire army by the Sassanid ruler Shapur I. The dam bridge was used until the late
                    19th century and today Band-e Kaisar is part of a larger UNESCO World Heritage Site in the area.

                <p>The Bridge near Limyra is a relatively unknown, yet unique stone bridge – it is believed to be one of
                    the oldest segmented arch bridges in the world. The bridge is located near the ancient city of
                    Limyra and is the largest civil engineering structure of antiquity in the region.

                    The way the arches of the bridge were built gives the bridge an unusually flat profile, which was
                    unique in Roman engineering at the time. Due to this fact and the lack of comparable structures, it
                    has been hard to date the construction of the bride, which is estimated to be sometime in the 3rd
                    century. Additionally, very little scientific research has been conducted on the bridge and there is
                    no information about the bridge from ancient sources.

                    The Karamagara Bridge was built sometime in the 5th or 6th century during the era of the Byzantine
                    Empire. The bridge consisted of a single pointed arch and is possibly the earliest known example of
                    a pointed arch bridge.

                    Karamagara Bridge was part of larger Roman road that led to the city of Melitene in the Eastern
                    Anatolia region of Turkey. The bridge is no longer usable today because it was submerged after the
                    completion of the Keban Dam in 1975. Before this, Karamagara Bridge was examined by the Middle East
                    Technical University of Ankara.</p>

The current bridge was built by the order of the Sassanid king, Shapur I, using seventy thousand Roman prisoners of war. itto.org It has been repaired several times during the reign of Azedodowleh Daylami, the Safavid, Qajar and early Pahlavi periods. The bridge currently has four large arches, and between every two of these is a smaller arch. Near the bridge, remnants of ancient mills can be observed. itto.org Since year 2010, motor vehicles are no longer permitted to use the bridge, because of its historic value. itto.org The Dezful bridge was constructed using dressed stone, mortar and is some places, baked clay brick. Unfortunately, due to natural causes, including seasonal floods on the Dez River, the bridge has suffered repetitive damage through the years. But even that was not strong enough to destroy this massive structure completely.</p>

                <p>The Rialto Bridge was the first permanent bridge constructed to pass over the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. The name comes from "RIvo Alto", meaning the "high channel" but has gradually become condensed to Rialto (Freeman). The bridge connects San Marco to San Polo. When migrants first reached this area, they saw it as an ideal area to cross the water, that became the Grand Canal, because the gap to the other side was narrower and there was firm enough ground to hold a structure (Freeman). But before the bridge was professionally constructed of wood in 1275, a line of boats stayed in the area to allow people and goods to cross the water to the food market. Next, a wooden bridge rose above the canal, but it collapsed a total of three times before the city decided to design the bridge in an alternative way in 1524 (2014). Antonio da Ponte was the architect of the marble bridge that stands today.</p>

                <p>Richmond in southern Tasmania is home to many buildings and structures built by convicts under the most appalling conditions. One such structure, the bridge over the Coal River at Richmond was completed in 1825, making it the oldest surviving freestone bridge in Australia. Its original name recallsFor some years Richmond had been used as a crossing point for people travelling by land to the Tasman and Forestier Peninsulas. The bridge was built by convict labour between 1823 and 1825 for movement of military, police and convicts between Hobart and Port Arthur. It was originally named Bigge's Bridge after John Thomas Bigge (1780-1843), an English judge and royal commissioner, who visited Australia in order to report on the state of the colonies. During his visit to Van Diemen's Land in 1820 he recognised the need for a bridge across the Coal River and authorised its construction.</p>
