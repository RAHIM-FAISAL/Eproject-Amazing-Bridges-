                    Dardanelles strait, about 10 km (6.2 mi) south of the Sea of Marmara. The bridge was officially

                    The year "1915" in the official Turkish name honours an important Ottoman naval victory against the
                    navies of the United Kingdom and France during World War I.</p>

                <p>Pingtang Bridge is located in Pingtanghe Village, Pingtang County, Guizhou Province, China.
                    The bridge runs from Tongzhou to the west, crosses the Caodu River Grand Canyon to the east, and
                    connects to Yazhou to the east. The route passes through Dachong Village, Daao Village, Tongzhou
                    Service Area Parking Lot, Luoyin Village, etc. It forms part of the Yuqing-Anlong Expressway (S26 of
                    Guizhou Expressway).

                    The construction started on April 29, 2016, and the main bridge closing project was completed on
                    September 26, 2019. The bridge was fully connected and opened to traffic on December 30, 2019.

                    The Bridge connects Tongzhou in the west, crosses the Caodu River Grand Canyon, and extends to
                    Yazhou in the east. The total length of the bridge is 2135 meters, and the main bridge is 30.2
                    meters wide. The bridge deck is a two-way four-lane highway with a design speed of 80 km / h. The
                    total investment is 1.5 billion yuan (US $ 215 million).</p>

                <p> HuSuTong Yangtze River Bridge is a control project of the newly built HuTong Railway. The structure
                    system is a cable-stayed bridge for highway and railway with a main span of 1092 m. The main girder
                    is a steel truss structure with three main trusses. The upper deck of the highway is an orthotropic
                    steel slab structure and the lower railway deck is a steel box structure. The upper and lower decks
                    bear the force together with the main truss. The stay cables of the bridge are set as a three-cable
                    plane structure. To meet the stress requirements, high strength bridge steel Q500qE and parallel
                    wire stay-cables with a strength of 2000 MPa were developed. In terms of dynamic performance, the
                    wind resistance of the structure is improved by using steel truss girders with good air permeability
                    and setting the transverse wind resistance bearings at the pier towers. The damping and energy
                    dissipation effect of the structure is remarkable by adopting a damping restraint system consisting
                    of dampers and a friction pendulum bearings.

                    Akashi Kaikyo is a 3.9km-long bridge built across the Akashi Strait, a 1,500m international shipping
                    canal that connects the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.

                    The suspension bridge connects the city of Kobe (mainland of Honshu) to Iwaya (Awaji Island) in
                    Japan. The spectacular view of the bridge in the night resulted in the name, Pearl Bridge.

                    The bridge was opened to traffic on 5 April 1998. It forms part of the Honshu-Shikoku Highway. The
                    original design of the bridge was prepared for both cars and trains. Later, the final design was
                    approved only for the road way. The bridge carries nearly 23,000 cars each day.

                    Research revealed the need for implementing new technology and maintenance techniques for proper
                    management and maintenance of the bridge. Dry air injection system was one of the technologies used,
                    which was used to maintain the bridge.</p>
