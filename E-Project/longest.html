                <p>The Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge is a 164.8-kilometre-long (102.4 mi) viaduct on the Beijing–
                    Shanghai High-Speed Railway. It is the longest bridge in the world.
                    The bridge is located on the rail line between Shanghai and Nanjing in Jiangsu province. It is in
                    the Yangtze River Delta where the geography is characterized by lowland rice paddies, canals,
                    rivers, and lakes. The bridge runs roughly parallel to the Yangtze River, about 8 to 80 km (5 to 50
                    mi) south of the river. It passes through the northern edges of population centers (from west to
                    east) beginning in Danyang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and ending in Kunshan. There is a 9-kilometre
                    long (5.6 mi) section over open water across Yangcheng Lake in Suzhou. Construction was completed in
                    2010 and the bridge opened in 2011. Employing 10,000 people, the project took four years and cost
                    about $8.5 billion.

                    Completed in 2004, the bridge is 157.317 kilometers (97.752 mi) in length. The railway is built
                    across a vast series of viaducts, as they were designed to be earthquake resistant to allow for
                    trains to stop safely during a seismic event and for repairable damage following a maximum design
                    earthquake. Bridges built over known fault lines were designed to survive fault movements without

                    Langfang and Qingxian, part of the Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway. It is one of the longest
                    bridges in the world with a total length of about 113.7 kilometers (70.6 mi). It was completed in
                    2010 and opened in 2011. At the time Guinness World Records recorded it as the second longest bridge
                    in the world.

                    The design of the elevated track was chosen on the one hand to avoid numerous individual structures
                    for crossing roads and railways, and on the other to shorten the construction period. In addition,
                    the railway line requires less land area in this design: a railway embankment requires 28.4 hectares
                    per routed kilometer, the bridge but only 10.9 ha, less than half the area.

                    surpassed by two new bridges on Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway that completed in 2010.
                    The bridge was completed in 2008 but the railway line itself did not open until February 6, 2010. It
                    is now the 3rd longest bridge in the world.
                    During construction of the Weinan Weihe Grand Bridge, there were at least 10,000 workers 2,300,000

                <p>The Manchac Swamp Bridge is a twin concrete trestle bridge in the US state of Louisiana. With a total
                    length of 22.80 miles (36.69 km), it is one of the longest bridges in the world over water and is
                    the longest bridge on the Interstate Highway System. Some claim it is the longest toll-free road
                    bridge in the world. The bridge carries Interstate 55 and U.S. Route 51 over the Manchac Swamp in
                    Louisiana and represents a third of the highway's approximately 66 miles (106 km) in Louisiana.
                    Opening in 1979, its piles were driven 250 feet (76 m) beneath the swamp and with the cost of the
                    span being $7 million per mile ($4.3 million/km) (equivalent to $21.4 million per mile ($13
                    million/km) in 2021) to complete.</p>

                <p>Hangzhou Bay Bridge is a long 35.7 km (22.2 mi) highway bridge with two separate cable-stayed
                    portions, built across the mouth of Hangzhou Bay in the eastern coastal region of China. It connects
                    the municipalities of Jiaxing and Ningbo in Zhejiang province. The bridge across the Hangzhou Bay
                    was the subject of various feasibility studies for over a decade before the final plans were
                    approved in 2003. An earlier plan placed the bridge further east, closer to the mouth of the bay,
                    which provided an even shorter travel distance between Ningbo and Shanghai. Under this plan, the
                    bridge would begin in the north from Jinshan, a suburb of Shanghai. The government of Shanghai
                    rejected the plan and focused on building the 32.5 km (20 mi)-long Donghai Bridge from Shanghai to
                    its off-shore port at Yangshan in the mouth of the bay.

                    The south bridge is a suspension bridge with a main span of 1,490 metres (4,888 ft). Upon its
                    completion in 2005 it became the third longest suspension bridge span in the world and the largest
                    in China.

It has a total length of 32.5 kilometres (20.2 mi) and connects mainland Shanghai's Pudong New Area with the offshore Yangshan Deep-Water Port in Zhejiang's Shengsi County. Most of the bridge is a low-level viaduct. There are also cable-stayed sections to allow for the passage of large ships, the largest with a span of 420 metres (1,380 ft). Donghai Bridge is part of the S2 Hulu Expressway.
                    The bridge has a long and narrow speedway and does not allow vehicles that do not meet the weight requirements.

                    The construction of the bridge was divided into six 'packages' or contracts. The first was CC1 or the Mentiri Tunnels which involved the construction of a series of tunnels through the Mentiri Ridges which connects Jalan Utama Mentiri, a controlled-access dual carriageway, with Jalan Kota Batu.

It opened in 1964, replacing ferries that had operated since the 1930s. A major project to dualize its bridges was completed in 1999, and a similar project to dualize one of its tunnels is currently underway. The CBBT was built and is operated by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel District, a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Virginia governed by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel Commission in cooperation with the Virginia Department of Transportation.</p>
